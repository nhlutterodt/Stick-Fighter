# Robust Logging Plan for StickFighter Project

This document outlines the plan to add robust logging across the four main HTML pages of the StickFighter project. Each page is a self-contained application with its own JavaScript logic. The goal is to standardize event logging to improve debugging, monitoring, and understanding of user interactions and game state changes.

---

## General Approach

- Introduce a centralized logging utility function in each page to standardize log formatting.
- Log key events, state changes, user interactions, and errors.
- Use `console.log` for informational logs and `console.error` for errors.
- Optionally, logs can be enhanced later to support different log levels or external logging services.

## index.html (Stickman Fighter Game)

### Logging Targets

- Game state transitions: loading, menu, fighting, paused, settings.
- Player actions: attacks (punch, kick, special moves), damage taken, parry, dodge.
- Power-up spawns and pickups.
- Menu button clicks and selections.
- Key events: pause/resume, reset.
- Player defeat events.

## character-creator.html (Character Creation Screen)

### Logging Targets

- Limb selection and deselection.
- Influence value changes on limbs.
- Color selection changes.
- Randomize character button clicks.
- Character generation events.

---

## terrain-creator.html (Terrain Painting)

### Logging Targets

- Painting start, ongoing painting actions, and painting stop.
- Window resize events.
- Any errors or unexpected states.

---

## world-generator.html (3D Procedural World Generator)

### Logging Targets

- Initialization steps and success/failure.
- UI control changes (terrain dimensions, noise parameters, brush size, paint type).
- Terrain regeneration and saving events.
- Painting start and stop.
- Animation loop start.
- Errors and critical failures.

---

## Follow-up Steps

- Implement the logging utility and add log statements as per the targets above.
- Test each page to verify logs appear correctly in the browser console.
- Optionally, add a logging toggle or log level control for production use.

This plan aims to provide comprehensive visibility into the application's behavior to facilitate debugging and future enhancements.
